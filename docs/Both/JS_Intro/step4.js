// jQuery is a useful library for interacting with a webpage.
// It's the '$' variable.
// Notice how this is a function passed into a function.
// This is very common in JS and is called a 'callback'.
// The callback will be called after the "ready" function executes.
$(document).ready(function() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
});
